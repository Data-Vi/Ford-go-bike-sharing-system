## Dataset

>This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

 In the exploratory, I performed and operation on the member_birth_year column to production the age of each member, which I did by subtracting their year from the present year(2022). I used fillna to cater for missing data and checked the distribution.
I also used the coordinate of each stations to get the distance cover in Kilometer.
The highest duration of age falls between age 30 and 40. The distance in km has outliers, I set the xlim. The distribution shows that most of the users covered distance between 0.5km to 2.5km.
 In the Member_gender, it is observed that male are the highest patronizer of the bike-sharing system. Relating member_gender to the user_type, it is clear that there are more male gender that are subcribers which is the same for female and the other gender.
For Member_gender in relation to age, it is observed that most male, female and the other gender are within the age range of 30 - 40.
There is no strong relationship between distance covered and duration spent.
Age does not affect the duration of time spent cycling or the distance covered in kilometers.
The relationship shows that subscribers cover more distance than customers. There is an outlier of distance at 70(km) and age aroung 140. Also there are more elder subcribers than customers.
It is observed that most subcriber of all gender type are within the age range of 30 - 40
There is an interesting interaction between the ages of people with other gender and the status of their bike usage. There seem to be more older and even younger other gender users who are subscribers than those who are customers. Another surprising interaction is that customers regardless of gender cover greater distance and spend more time compared with subscribers.
## Key Insights for Presentation

 It is fascinating to observe that the highest patronizers of Fordgobike system are males regardless of their user status, that is, whether they are subscribers or customers.
The age of the male users did not show any relationship with user status but that of the other gender did and the female gender slightly did
Gender showed no difference in distance covered and time spent with bike, customers regardless of gender cover greater distance and spend more time compared with subscribers.
